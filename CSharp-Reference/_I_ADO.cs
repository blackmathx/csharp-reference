class _I_ADO
{
    /*
        * ADO.NET (Active Data Objects for .NET) is a data access framework in .NET used to interact directly with relational databases like SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, etc.
        * 
        * ADO.NET is comparable to Java JDBC since it's low level access whereas EF is similar to Hibernate in Java.
        * 
        * Core Concepts:
        *    Low-level data access (manual control over connection, commands, etc.)
        *    Part of the System.Data namespace
        *    Works with disconnected and connected data models
        *    
        * When to Use ADO.NET:
        *    Full control over SQL and performance
        *    Legacy systems
        *    Lightweight scenarios without ORM (like EF Core)
        *
        * In ASP.NET Core:
        *    ADO.NET can be used for data access, though Entity Framework Core is more common for modern projects due to its abstraction and LINQ support.
